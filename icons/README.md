# Icons Directory

Place your extension icon files here in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create simple placeholder icons or design custom ones. For a quick start, you can:

1. Use an online icon generator
2. Create simple PNG files with your preferred design tool
3. Use a print/printer icon as the theme

## Temporary Solution

If you want to test the extension immediately without custom icons, you can create simple colored squares as placeholders.
